sun = Sun(warsaw_lat, warsaw_lon)

# Get today's sunrise and sunset in UTC
today_sr = sun.get_sunrise_time()
today_ss = sun.get_sunset_time()
print('Today at Warsaw the sun raised at {} and get down at {} UTC'.
      format(today_sr.strftime('%H:%M'), today_ss.strftime('%H:%M')))

# On a special date in your machine's local time zone
abd = datetime.date(2014, 10, 3)
abd_sr = sun.get_sunrise_time(abd, tz.gettz('Europe/Warsaw'))
abd_ss = sun.get_sunset_time(abd, tz.gettz('Europe/Warsaw'))
print('On {} the sun at Warsaw raised at {} and get down at {}.'.
      format(abd, abd_sr.strftime('%H:%M'), abd_ss.strftime('%H:%M')))

# Error handling (no sunset or sunrise on given location)
latitude = 87.55
longitude = 0.1
sun = Sun(latitude, longitude)
try:
    abd_sr = sun.get_sunrise_time(abd)
    abd_ss = sun.get_sunset_time(abd)
    print('On {} at somewhere in the north the sun raised at {} and get down at {}.'.
          format(abd, abd_sr.strftime('%H:%M'), abd_ss.strftime('%H:%M')))
